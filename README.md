## HW1
Try to design 32-bit Ripple carry adder with 3 different modeling and also please provide the version that D-flip flop included inside.  
You should implement `Pre-simulation`, `Compiler`, `Post-simulation`.  

## HW2
pipeline of Add/SUB and Multiplier with or without clockgating, use Design compiler and PrimeTime to analyze.  

## HW3
Debugging for the THUMB pipeline and try to do APR to get the layout.  

## HW4
Sobel edge detector with self created hardware design.  

## HW5 & HW6
An AI accelerator of VGG16.  
HW6 is simiar to HW5, but try to add SRAM architecture.
